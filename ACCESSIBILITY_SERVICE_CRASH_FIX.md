# AccessibilityService Crash Fix - onStartCommand Removal

## Issue
After the previous fix (PR #7) that changed `startService()` to `sendBroadcast()`, the app still crashed when opening. The issue was not fully resolved despite addressing the primary communication problem.

## Root Cause
The `NetworkResetAccessibilityService` class had an **incorrect `onStartCommand()` method** that should not exist in an AccessibilityService.

### Why This Causes Crashes

1. **AccessibilityService Lifecycle**: AccessibilityServices are **bound services**, not started services. They are bound by the Android system, not started by applications.

2. **Conflicting Lifecycle Methods**: The presence of `onStartCommand()` in an AccessibilityService creates a conflict:
   - AccessibilityServices use `onServiceConnected()` and `onUnbind()`
   - Regular Services use `onStartCommand()` and `onDestroy()`
   - Mixing these lifecycle methods causes undefined behavior and crashes

3. **System Expectations**: When the Android system binds to an AccessibilityService, it expects it to follow the bound service lifecycle. The presence of `onStartCommand()` confuses the system and can cause crashes during binding or initialization.

### The Problematic Code (NetworkResetAccessibilityService.kt lines 150-162)
```kotlin
override fun onStartCommand(intent: Intent?, flags: Int, startId: Int): Int {
    when (intent?.action) {
        ACTION_START_RESET -> {
            Log.d(TAG, "Starting network reset process")
            startProcessing()
        }
        ACTION_STOP_RESET -> {
            Log.d(TAG, "Stopping network reset process")
            stopProcessing()
        }
    }
    return START_STICKY  // ❌ THIS IS INCORRECT FOR ACCESSIBILITY SERVICE!
}
```

## Solution
**Removed the `onStartCommand()` method** from `NetworkResetAccessibilityService.kt`.

The communication is now correctly handled entirely through the BroadcastReceiver that was added in PR #7:

### Correct Communication Flow

```
MainActivity (when user taps button)
    ↓
sendBroadcast(ACTION_START_RESET)
    ↓
NetworkResetAccessibilityService's BroadcastReceiver
    ↓ (registered in onServiceConnected)
onReceive() → startProcessing()
    ↓
✅ Works correctly!
```

### Correct Lifecycle for AccessibilityService

```kotlin
class NetworkResetAccessibilityService : AccessibilityService() {
    
    // ✅ CORRECT: Called when system binds the service
    override fun onServiceConnected() {
        super.onServiceConnected()
        // Register BroadcastReceiver here
        commandReceiver = object : BroadcastReceiver() {
            override fun onReceive(context: Context?, intent: Intent?) {
                when (intent?.action) {
                    ACTION_START_RESET -> startProcessing()
                    ACTION_STOP_RESET -> stopProcessing()
                }
            }
        }
        registerReceiver(commandReceiver, filter, Context.RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED)
    }
    
    // ✅ CORRECT: Clean up when service is destroyed
    override fun onDestroy() {
        super.onDestroy()
        commandReceiver?.let { unregisterReceiver(it) }
    }
    
    // ❌ REMOVED: This should NOT exist in AccessibilityService
    // override fun onStartCommand(...) { }
}
```

## Why This Fix Works

### Before (Broken)
```
System tries to bind AccessibilityService
    ↓
Finds unexpected onStartCommand() method
    ↓
💥 CRASH - Lifecycle conflict
```

### After (Fixed)
```
System binds AccessibilityService
    ↓
Calls onServiceConnected()
    ↓
BroadcastReceiver registered
    ↓
MainActivity sends broadcast when needed
    ↓
✅ Clean lifecycle, no crashes!
```

## Key Differences Between Service Types

| Service Type | How it's Started | Lifecycle Methods | Communication |
|--------------|------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Started Service** | `startService()` | `onStartCommand()`, `onDestroy()` | Direct via Intent |
| **Bound Service** | `bindService()` | `onBind()`, `onUnbind()` | Binder interface |
| **AccessibilityService** | System binding | `onServiceConnected()`, `onDestroy()` | BroadcastReceiver, Binder |

**AccessibilityService is a special type of bound service** - it should NEVER have `onStartCommand()`.

## Testing Recommendations

1. ✅ **Build the APK**: Ensure the app compiles without errors
2. ✅ **Install on device**: Install the updated APK
3. ✅ **Open the app**: Verify the app opens without crashing
4. ✅ **Enable accessibility service**: Go to Settings > Accessibility and enable "Mobile Network Reset"
5. ✅ **Return to app**: App should still be open without crash
6. ✅ **Tap "Automated Reset"**: Button should trigger the accessibility automation
7. ✅ **Verify automation**: Network reset automation should start correctly

## Security Considerations

✅ **No security impact**: Removing `onStartCommand()` doesn't affect security  
✅ **BroadcastReceiver still secure**: Uses `Context.RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED` on API 33+  
✅ **Package-scoped broadcasts**: MainActivity uses `setPackage(packageName)`  
✅ **Proper cleanup**: Receiver is unregistered in `onDestroy()`

## Summary

The crash was caused by an **architectural mistake**: mixing the lifecycle of a started service (`onStartCommand()`) with an accessibility service (which is bound by the system). By removing the incorrect `onStartCommand()` method and relying entirely on the BroadcastReceiver communication pattern added in PR #7, the app now follows the correct AccessibilityService lifecycle and should no longer crash on opening.
