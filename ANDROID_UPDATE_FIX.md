# Android Update Fix

## Problem
This repository needed Android build tool updates to maintain compatibility with current Android development standards and avoid update errors.

## Solution
Updated the following components to their latest stable versions:

### 1. Android Gradle Plugin (AGP)
- **Before**: 8.1.4
- **After**: 8.5.2
- **Reason**: Newer AGP versions provide better compatibility with current Android SDKs, improved build performance, and bug fixes

### 2. Kotlin Plugin
- **Before**: 1.9.0
- **After**: 2.0.21
- **Reason**: Kotlin 2.x includes important language improvements, better compiler performance, and enhanced null safety features

### 3. AndroidX Dependencies
Updated all AndroidX libraries to their latest stable versions:

- **core-ktx**: 1.12.0 → 1.13.1
- **appcompat**: 1.6.1 → 1.7.0
- **material**: 1.10.0 → 1.12.0
- **test.ext:junit**: 1.1.5 → 1.2.1
- **espresso-core**: 3.5.1 → 3.6.1

## Changes Made

### Files Modified
1. `build.gradle` - Updated AGP and Kotlin versions
2. `app/build.gradle` - Updated AndroidX dependency versions

### No Breaking Changes
- `compileSdk` remains at 34
- `targetSdk` remains at 34
- `minSdk` remains at 28
- Java compatibility remains at VERSION_1_8
- All existing functionality preserved
