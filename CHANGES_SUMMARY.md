## Key Changes Explained

### Before This Fix

```
Release Build ‚Üí app-release-unsigned.apk ‚Üí Upload to GitHub
                        ‚Üì
                  Users Download
                        ‚Üì
                "Invalid APK" Error ‚ùå
```

### After This Fix

```
Release Build ‚Üí app-release.apk (SIGNED) ‚Üí Upload to GitHub
                        ‚Üì
                  Users Download
                        ‚Üì
                  Installs Successfully ‚úÖ
```

## Technical Details

### Signing Configuration Added

```groovy
signingConfigs {
    debug {
        // Uses default Android debug keystore
    }
}

buildTypes {
    debug {
        signingConfig signingConfigs.debug
    }
    release {
        signingConfig signingConfigs.debug  // Debug signing for open-source
    }
}
```

### Why Debug Signing for Release?

For this open-source project, using debug signing for releases is appropriate because:

‚úÖ **Acceptable**:
- Source code is public
- Not a commercial/monetized app
- No sensitive user data
- Allows easy installation by users
- All contributors can build identical APKs

‚ùå **NOT Suitable** for:
- Play Store distribution
- Commercial applications
- Apps handling sensitive data
- Apps requiring unique developer identity

## Testing the Fix

### Option 1: Local Build Test

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/CrhistIsKingSoftware/android-mobile-network-reset.git
cd android-mobile-network-reset

# Build release APK
./gradlew assembleRelease

# Verify it's signed
apksigner verify --verbose app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk

# Install on device
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

### Option 2: Wait for Next Release

1. Wait for a new release to be created
2. Download the APK from GitHub Releases
3. Install on your Android device
4. It should install successfully!

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Build configuration uses modern Gradle syntax
- [x] Signing configuration explicitly defined
- [x] Release workflow updated to distribute signed APKs
- [x] Documentation added explaining the fix
- [x] README updated with troubleshooting guide
- [ ] CI/CD build passes (requires merge to main)
- [ ] APK installation tested on device (requires release)

## Impact

| Area | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| **User Experience** | Cannot install | Can install ‚úÖ |
| **Build System** | Deprecated config | Modern Gradle 8.x ‚úÖ |
| **CI/CD** | Uploads unsigned APK | Uploads signed APK ‚úÖ |
| **Documentation** | Missing | Comprehensive ‚úÖ |

## Next Steps

1. **Merge this PR** to the main branch
2. **Create a new release** (e.g., v1.0.1)
3. **Test installation** of the new release APK
4. **Notify users** that the issue is fixed

## Future Improvements

For production-grade releases, consider:

1. Generate a dedicated release keystore
2. Store keystore credentials in GitHub Secrets
3. Update build.gradle to use production keystore for releases
4. Document keystore backup and recovery procedures

See [APK_SIGNING_FIX.md](APK_SIGNING_FIX.md) for detailed guidance.
