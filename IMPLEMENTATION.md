# Implementation Notes

## Overview
This Android application was created to solve mobile network connectivity issues by automating the network operator reset process.

## Architecture

### MainActivity
The main entry point of the application. It provides:
- A simple, user-friendly interface with Material Design components
- A button to initiate the network reset process
- A button to directly access network settings
- Status messages to guide the user through the process
- Instructions on how the network reset works

### Key Features Implemented

1. **Network Reset Button**: Triggers the network reset process
   - Opens a toast message with step-by-step instructions
   - Launches the network operator settings screen
   - Provides visual feedback during the process

2. **Settings Access**: Direct access to network operator settings
   - Opens Android's network operator settings
   - Falls back to general wireless settings if operator settings aren't available

3. **User Guidance**: Clear instructions throughout the UI
   - Explains the 4-step process in a card view
   - Shows current status of operations
   - Provides helpful error messages

### Android Permissions

The app declares the following permissions in AndroidManifest.xml:
- `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE`: To check network connectivity status
- `CHANGE_NETWORK_STATE`: To modify network settings
- `MODIFY_PHONE_STATE`: System-level permission for network operator selection

**Important Note**: `MODIFY_PHONE_STATE` is a system-level permission that regular apps cannot obtain through normal installation. This is an Android security restriction to prevent malicious apps from interfering with phone functionality.

### Implementation Approach

Due to Android security restrictions, the app takes a **guided manual approach** rather than fully automated:

1. **What doesn't work**: Programmatically toggling network selection modes without system permissions
2. **What we implemented**: 
   - Opening the correct settings screen (ACTION_NETWORK_OPERATOR_SETTINGS)
   - Providing clear step-by-step guidance
   - Handling edge cases and fallback scenarios

This approach:
- Works on all Android devices without requiring root access
- Provides a much faster workflow than navigating settings manually
- Maintains security by not requiring dangerous permissions
- Offers the best user experience within Android's constraints

### Resources

The app includes:
- **Layout**: activity_main.xml - ScrollView-based layout with ConstraintLayout
- **Strings**: All user-facing text is externalized for internationalization
- **Colors**: Material Design color palette
- **Themes**: Material Components theme
- **Icons**: Vector drawable launcher icon

### Build Configuration

- **Minimum SDK**: API 26 (Android 8.0 Oreo)
- **Target SDK**: API 34 (Android 14)
- **Compile SDK**: API 34
- **Build Tools**: Compatible with Android Gradle Plugin 8.1.4
- **Kotlin Version**: 1.9.0
- **JDK Requirement**: Java 17 or higher

### Dependencies

Key dependencies used:
- AndroidX Core KTX
- AppCompat
- Material Components
- ConstraintLayout

All dependencies use stable, production-ready versions.

## Testing Considerations

To properly test this app:

1. **Physical Device**: Must be tested on a real Android device with cellular capabilities
2. **Network Conditions**: Best tested in areas with poor network connectivity
3. **Operator Settings**: Verify that the device allows access to network operator settings

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements for future versions:

1. **Root/System App Version**: For rooted devices or system apps, implement full automation
2. **Accessibility Service**: Use AccessibilityService to automate the tapping in settings (requires user permission)
3. **Network Monitoring**: Add background service to detect network issues and notify user
4. **Auto-trigger**: Detect network failures and prompt user to run reset
5. **Statistics**: Track success rate and network quality improvements
6. **Multiple Languages**: Add internationalization support for Portuguese (Brazil) and other languages

## Known Limitations

1. Cannot fully automate the process without system-level permissions
2. Requires manual user interaction in the Settings app
3. Some device manufacturers may restrict access to network operator settings
4. Effectiveness depends on the specific network conditions and operator availability

## CI/CD Pipeline

The project includes GitHub Actions workflows:

### android-ci.yml
- Triggers on push/PR to main and develop branches
- Builds the app
- Runs lint checks
- Runs unit tests
- Uploads debug APK as artifact
- Uploads lint reports

### android-release.yml
- Triggers on version tags (v*)
- Builds release APK
- Creates GitHub release
- Uploads APK to release assets

## Development Environment

Recommended setup:
- Android Studio Hedgehog (2023.1.1) or newer
- JDK 17 (required for Gradle 8.2)
- Android SDK with API 34
- Kotlin plugin 1.9.0 or newer

## Building the Project

```bash
# Debug build
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Release build
./gradlew assembleRelease

# Run tests
./gradlew test

# Run lint
./gradlew lint
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build Issues
- Ensure ANDROID_HOME is set correctly
- Verify JDK 17 or higher is installed
- Check that Android SDK API 34 is installed
- Run `./gradlew clean` if builds fail

### Runtime Issues
- Verify device has telephony capabilities
- Check that network operator settings are accessible on the device
- Ensure the app has necessary permissions (though most are just for checking status)
